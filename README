NoLimit

webmachine/bitcask proof of concept for a disk backed, fast k/v cache

DISCLAIMER: I am not an erlang programmer (though I'd like to be), so this code has tons of mistakes, feel free to clown me out.

TODO: 
* Make it support more than a single write at a time (perhaps by putting bitcask behind a process?)

INSTALL:

0) brew install erlang
1) git clone git://github.com:capotej/nolimit.git
2) cd nolimit
3) make
4) ./start.sh


USAGE: 

SET
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ -d "foo=bar"

GET
curl http://localhost:8000/?key=foo
